# Who we are

Candelique is at the forefront of innovation in the candle industry, blending sustainability with cutting-edge designs. Our commitment to eco-friendly practices is matched only by our dedication to creating unique, memorable candles that enhance any space.


# What we use

**Beeswax** 

Another natural, eco-friendly wax option. Beeswax candles purify the air by emitting negative ions when burned and have a natural, subtle honey scent.

**Cotton Wicks:**

Lead-free and made from natural fibers. These wicks ensure a clean burn and are preferred over metal wicks for health and environmental reasons.

**Essential Oils:**

Used for fragrance, essential oils are derived from plants and are a natural alternative to synthetic fragrances. They offer aromatherapeutic benefits.

**Recycled or Biodegradable Containers:**

Containers made from recycled glass or metal, or biodegradable materials like bamboo, reduce waste and environmental impact.

**Natural Dyes:**

If color is desired, using dyes made from natural, non-toxic sources ensures sustainability and reduces the chemical footprint.

**Minimal Packaging:**

Using minimal, recycled, or recyclable packaging materials reduces waste and environmental impact.

**Handcrafted Production:**

Small scale, artisanal production methods often have a lower carbon footprint compared to mass production.
